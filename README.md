### About Neofetch (Alexia's Fork)

Neofetch is a commandline system information tool originally written in bash. 

The original project has been cancelled and its repository is now read-only. 

I will try, as my time allows it, to maintain it from now on and keep adding information for the many distros out there


Original Project: [https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)


If you wish to add a distro to my version of neofetch please open an issue. 

Thanks!

Alexia.
